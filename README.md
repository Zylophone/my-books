# My Books

First project of the React Nanodegree from Udacity. It is a simple app with [React]('https://facebook.github.io/react/') to manage the books you are currently reading, your read books and the pending ones. 

It allows you to move books from one shelf to another and search for new books and add them to your library.

The project has been developed using [React]('https://facebook.github.io/react/') and [Bulma](http://bulma.io/). 

***Important.** The project uses a backend provided by the **Udacity** teachers. If you want access to the project and use it, contact me first.*
